      <ul>


        <li><b> Mouce - Cross Platform Mouse Library</b></li>
        <p>
          Mouce is a library written in Rust that aims to help simulating and listening mouse actions across different platforms. It makes use of several system libraries like Win32, CoreGraphics & CoreFoundation, X11, and uinput to create an interface to simulate mouse movements/clicks. The project also offers a functionality to listen the mouse movements and actions. It supports major operating systems like Windows, MacOS, Linux X11 and partially Linux Wayland as well (See github readme for details). The project has an MIT license and can be accessed at

            .

        <li><b> Torch </b></li>
        <p>
          The aim of the project Torch is to make visually impaired people's
          lives easier. The core of the project is an API that can be accessed
          over HTTP. This API serves functionalities that are powered with
          machine learning techniques such as CNN's k-NN's etc. Some example
          functionalities are; Turkish banknote-detection, ocr, color-detection
          and object-detection. All of these services are accepting image input.
          An example Django server that serves this API and an example PWA
          project was also developed.

        <p>
        During my employement at motius I contributed to the development of an API-Gateway project, that elevates low-level APIs (e.g. CAN bus, SomeIP) tohigher level event-driven APIs (e.g. MQTT, HTTP server-side-events) defined in AsyncAPI and OpenAPI standards. Gateway project is written in Rust, and I am part of the development team where we develop new features, fix bugs, introduce unit and integration tests, and maintain CI/CD jobs on GitLab.
        </p>

        Worked with the LogoHR team for a year, helped my team maintain and improve web based HR projects with .NET MVC, .Net Core and jQuery by following the scrum principles, used Jira for issue tracking and git for version control. Automated manual CI/CD processes by writing a Python script and simplified the recurring tasks. Introduced mobile cross platform solutions to my team and contributed to a mobile application written in React Native. Before my full time employement, I worked as an intern with the Logo Retail team for a month, resolved bugs on the cloud based projects using C# and TS.

        <li><b>DEU Computer Engineering, <i>Hardware Engineer Internship </i> <mark> Jan 2020 - Feb 2020</mark> </b></li>
        <p>
        Built a prototype of a medical sleeve using smart textile and gyroscope sensors connected to Arduino. Created a Windows Forms application that interfaces with Arduino via COM ports to monitor the gyroscope readings
        </p>
        <li><b>AirTies Wireless Networks, <i>Software Engineer Internship</i> <mark> July 2019 - Aug 2019</mark> </b></li>
        <p>
        Developed a software for access point devices to perform network traffic analysis using C and JavaScript.

      <h3>Education</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Technical University of Munich, <i>Computer Science M.Sc.</i> <mark> Oct 2021 - Apr 2025</mark> </b></li>
        <p>
          While studying at TUM, I got involved in multiple courses and topics that would focus on distributed systems, cloud computing, and systems programming. My master's thesis focus is on improving the BtrBlocks interoperability with on-demand translation. BtrBlocks is an efficient columnar compression for data lakes, and my ongoing work focuses on creating Rust bindings and implementing the BtrBlocks compression into other projects like apache datafusion.
        </p>
        <li><b>Dokuz Eylül University, <i>Computer Engineering B.Sc.</i> <mark> Sep 2016 - Oct 2020</mark> </b></li>
        <p>
        DEU is the place where I met with many software development topics, such as algorithms, algorithm analysis, data structures, object oriented programming, network systems, operating systems and many more. During my time there, I have been involved in 3 individual internships where I have had my first real time software development experiences. My senior project is called <a href="https://github.com/omothm/torch-api">Torch</a> where we developed multiple machine learning models that focuces on helping visually imparied people on day to day tasks. The models were also exposed as a service over an HTTP api and the project was awarded with the special award of Senior Projects / Open Source Software Category by <a href="https://gbyf.org.tr/">BMO</a>.
