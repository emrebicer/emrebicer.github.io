    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I enjoy working with electronic devices, especially computers. My focus
      area is on software development and I am interested in <u>systems programming</u> and <u>backend development</u>
      topics.
      Currently, I am studying towards my Master's degree at the Technical
      University of Munich and I plan to finish my studies at the end of April 2025.
    </p>

    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Motius, <i>Software Engineer - Working Student </i> <mark> Feb 2023 - Apr 2025</mark> </b></li>
      <p>
        During my employment at Motius, I contributed to the development of multiple projects. The most impactful one
        being an API-Gateway project, that elevates low-level APIs (e.g., CAN bus, SomeIP) to higher-level event-driven
        APIs (e.g., MQTT, HTTP server-side-events) defined in AsyncAPI and OpenAPI standards. The gateway project is
        written in Rust and developed for a leading automotive company. I was part of the development team where we
        developed new features, fixed bugs, introduced unit and integration tests, and maintained CI/CD jobs on GitLab.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also contributed to other projects where I implemented an automated certificate signing process, which
        involves multiple parties such as a remote signing server and local yubikey devices for secret and identity
        validation. Additionally, I have implemented a backend and frontend for this signing station, making this
        automated process accessible to workers without technical knowledge.
      </p>
      <li><b>Logo Yazilim, <i>Software Engineer </i> <mark> July 2020 - Aug 2021</mark> </b></li>
      <p>
        Worked with the LogoHR team for a year, helped my team maintain and improve web based HR projects with .NET MVC,
        .Net Core and jQuery by following the scrum principles, used Jira for issue tracking and git for version
        control. Automated manual CI/CD processes by writing a Python script and simplified the recurring tasks.
        Introduced mobile cross platform solutions to my team and contributed to a mobile application written in React
        Native.

      </p>
      <li><b>AirTies Wireless Networks, <i>Software Engineer Internship</i> <mark> July 2019 - Aug 2019</mark> </b></li>
      <p>
        Developed a software for access point devices to perform network traffic analysis using C and JavaScript.
        Implemented the access point interface (that fetches real-time data) for web browsers. Wrote bash scripts to
        gather and store data on a cloud database, using Linux. Learned about the TCP/IP and HTTP protocols to implement
        a private messaging program. Conducted experiments to maximize data throughput of access point devices with
        Python.
      </p>
    </ul>

    <h3>Education</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Technical University of Munich, <i>Computer Science M.Sc.</i> <mark> Oct 2021 - Apr 2025</mark> </b></li>
      <p>
        While studying at TUM, I got involved in multiple courses and topics that would focus on distributed systems,
        cloud computing, and systems programming. My master's thesis focus is on improving the <a
          href="https://github.com/maxi-k/btrblocks">BtrBlocks</a> interoperability with on-demand translation.
        BtrBlocks is an efficient columnar compression format designed for high compression ratios and fast
        decompression, enabling rapid data retrieval from remote storage in high-speed network environments. The
        resulting <a href="https://github.com/emrebicer/btrblocks-rs">Rust library</a> achieves feature parity with the
        original C++ library, supporting compression and decompression. A binary tool was also developed, offering
        features such as CSV compression/decompression, mounting CSV files from remote BtrBlocks storage, on-demand CSV
        translation, and SQL querying on compressed files.
      </p>
      <li><b>Dokuz Eylül University, <i>Computer Engineering B.Sc.</i> <mark> Sep 2016 - Oct 2020</mark> </b></li>
      <p>
        DEU is the place where I met with many software development topics, such as algorithms, algorithm analysis, data
        structures, object oriented programming, network systems, operating systems and many more. During my time there,
        I have been involved in 3 individual internships where I have had my first real time software development
        experiences. My senior project is called <a href="https://github.com/omothm/torch-api">Torch</a> where we
        developed multiple machine learning models that focuces on helping visually imparied people on day to day tasks.
        The models were also exposed as a service over an HTTP api and the project was awarded with the special award of
        Senior Projects / Open Source Software Category by <a href="https://gbyf.org.tr/">BMO</a>.
      </p>
    </ul>

    <h3>Projects</h3>

    <p>These are some of the projects that I have contributed / developed;</p>
    <ul>


      <li><b> Mouce - Cross Platform Mouse Library</b></li>
      <p>
        Mouce is a library written in Rust that aims to help simulating and listening mouse actions across different
        platforms. It makes use of several system libraries like Win32, CoreGraphics & CoreFoundation, X11, and uinput
        to create an interface to simulate mouse movements/clicks. The project also offers a functionality to listen the
        mouse movements and actions. It supports major operating systems like Windows, MacOS, Linux X11 and partially
        Linux Wayland as well (See github readme for details). The project has an MIT license and can be accessed at
        <a href="https://github.com/emrebicer/mouce" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> or
        <a href="https://crates.io/crates/mouce" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crates.io</a>
        .


        <li><b> BtrBlocks - Rust Library </b></li>
      <p>
        BtrBlocks is an efficient columnar compression format designed for high compression ratios and fast
        decompression. It is originally written in C++, and my master's thesis focused on making it accessible in the
        Rust ecosystem while providing feature parity and offering additional features.

      <li><b> Torch </b></li>
      <p>
        The aim of the project Torch is to make visually impaired people's
        lives easier. The core of the project is an API that can be accessed
        over HTTP. This API serves functionalities that are powered with
        machine learning techniques such as CNN's k-NN's etc. Some example
        functionalities are; Turkish banknote-detection, ocr, color-detection
        and object-detection. All of these services are accepting image input.
        An example Django server that serves this API and an example PWA
        project was also developed.
